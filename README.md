# Cannon-Baller

Smiths cannonballs in Edgeville. Start in Edgeville, and it will detect whether to start at the bank or go straight to the furnace. 
As soon as the start button is pressed it will start running the bot.
A small amount of load time (usually 5-10 seconds) will happen, and this is just for the window to pop up and for the bot to determine what needs to happen first.

## Recommended for mobile only due to there being no anti-ban features included.

Very low requirements! Only 35 smithing and Dwarf Cannon quest are needed.
Low starting capital makes it easy to manage risk while still maximizing profits.
